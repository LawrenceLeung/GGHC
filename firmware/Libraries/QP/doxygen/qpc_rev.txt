\section qpc_4_1_07 Version 4.1.07 (Product) Release date: Feb 28, 2011

The goal of this release is to improve the ease of experimenting with
QP/C on the desktop. This release adds support for Windows (Win32) to
the baseline code. Two most popular compilers for Windows are supported:
Microsoft Visual Studio and MinGW (GNU). The support for Linux has been
improved by including pre-built QP/C libraries and improving makefiles
for Eclipse compatibility.

The changes in detail are:

1. Added Win32 port with the Visual C++ 2008 (ports/80x86/win32/vc2008).
This directory contains the Visual Studio solution all_qp.sln for
building all QP/C libraries from the IDE. Three build configurations
(Debug, Release, and Spy) are supported.

2. Added Win32 port with the MinGW comiler (ports/80x86/win32/mingw).
This directory contains the Makefile for building all QP/C libraries.
Three build configurations (dbg, rel, and spy) are supported.
NOTE: the Makefile assumes that the MinGW/bin directory is added
to the PATH.

3. Added Win32 examples for Visual C++ 2008 (examples/80x86/win32/
vc2008/dpp and examples/80x86/win32/vc2008/qhsmtst). Visual Studio
soultions are provides for all build configurations.

4. Added Win32 examples for MinGW (examples/80x86/win32/mingw/dpp
and examples/80x86/win32/mingw/qhsmtst). Eclipse-compatible makefiles
are provided for all build configurations. NOTE: the Makefiles assume
that the MinGW/bin directory is added to the PATH.

5. Removed memory alignment correction in the file qmp_init.c. This
correction required casting of pointers to integers and was problematic
on 64-bit targets (such as 64-bit Linux).

6. Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with CodeSourcery to the
latest Sourcery G++ 2011.02-2.


\section qpc_4_1_06 Version 4.1.06 (Product) Release date: Jan 07, 2011

1. Made cosmetic improvements to the example QM models of the
"Fly 'n' Shoot" game. 

2. Made improvements in make.bat files for building the examples for
DOS/Open Watcom to run better in DosBox on Linux.

3. Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with IAR to the latest
IAR EWARM version 6.10.

4. Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with CodeSourcery to the
latest Sourcery G++ 2010.09-66.


\section qpc_4_1_05 Version 4.1.05 (Product) Release date: Nov 01, 2010

This release is adds examples for the QM (QP Modeler) graphical modeling
and code generation tool. The examples are based on the "Fly 'n' Shoot"
game described in the QP/C Tutorial and in Chapter 1 of the PSiCC2 book.

Specifically, the directory <qpc>/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/game-qm/
contains the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game model file "game.qm". This model, when
opened in the QM tool contains all state machine diagrams and generates
code into the subdirectory qm_code/. This code can then be built and
executed on any 80x86 machine (newer versions of Windows or Linux require
the DOSbox application, see http://www.dosbox.com).

The directory <qpc>/examples/arm-cortex/vanilla/iar/game-ev-lm3s811-qm/
contains the version of the game for the EV-LM3S811 ARM Cortex-M3 board.
This directory contains the model file "game.qm", which is actually
identical as the model in the DOS version. The LM3S811 version needs to
be compiled with the IAR compiler and executed on the EV-LM3S811 board.

Additionally, the QP/C baseline code has been slighlty modified for
better conformance to the MISRA C 2004 rules and the latest PC-Lint 9.x. 


\section qpc_4_1_04 Version 4.1.04 (Product) Release date: Mar 16, 2010

This release is adds compatibility of all examples for DOS with the DOSBox
emulator (http://www.dosbox.com/) that recreates a MS-DOS compatible
environment on all versions of Windows, including 64-bit Windows that don't
run 16-bit DOS applications anymore.

Also, this release includes QP ports and examples for EV-LM3S811 board with
the GNU-based Code Sourcery G++ toolset. Support for Sourcery G++ provides
a very cost-effective option for developing QP applications for ARM Cortex
MCUs. 

Finally, this release improves the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface
Standard (CMSIS) for the whole family of the Stellaris LM3Sxxx MCUs. The
improvement extends the CMSIS from Sandstorm to Fury, DustDevil, and Tempest
Stellaris families.  


\section qpc_4_1_03 Version 4.1.03 (Product) Release date: Jan 21, 2010

This release is concerned with the ARM Cortex ports and examples.
Specifically, this release contains the following improvements:

1. Unified source code for ARM Cortex-M3 and the new ARM Cortex-M0 cores,
including the code for the preemptive QK kernel.

2. Compliance with the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard
(CMSIS) in all ARM Cortex examples.

3. Backward-compatible support for the new LM3S811 EVAL Rev C board with
different OLED display than previous revisions. (NOTE: The OSRAM 96x16x1 OLED
used in REV A-B boards has been replaced RITEK 96x16x1 OLED used in Rev C.)

In the process of making the examples CMSIS-compliant, the dependency on the
Luminary Micro driver library (driverlib.a) has been completely removed.

Additionally, the screen saver of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game has been improved
to periodically switch off the power of the OLED display, which better
protects the display from burn-in. The affected file is tunnel.c.

Finally, this release introduces the QP_VERSION macro, which identifies the QP
version. Otherwise, this maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in
any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications except for the
ARM Cortex ports and applications. 


\section qpc_4_1_02 Version 4.1.02 (Product) Release date: Jan 14, 2010

The purpose of this minor maintenance release is the change in the directory
structure for the ARM Cortex ports and examples. As new ARM Cortex cores are
becoming available, the old port name "cortex-m3" could be misleading, because
it actually applies to wider range of ARM Cortex cores. Consequently, all ARM
Cortex ports and examples are hosted in the directory tree called
"arm-cortex".

This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the
release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications except for the ARM Cortex
ports and applications. 


\section qpc_4_1_01 Version 4.1.01 (Product) Release date: Nov 05, 2009

The main purpose of this release is to replace the Turbo C++ 1.01 toolset
with the Open Watcom C/C++ toolset, because Turbo C++ 1.01 is no longer
available for a free download. In contrast, Open Watcom is distributed under
an OSI-certified open source license, which permits free commercial and
non-commercial use. Open Watcom can be downloaded from www.openwatcom.org.

All 80x86/DOS, 80x86/qk, and 80x86/ucos2 ports and examples for Turbo C++ 1.01
have been replaced with ports and examples for Open Watcom. The make.bat
scripts are provided to build the QP/C libraries and examples.

In the process of converting the examples to Open Watcom two new examples
have been added to the standard QP/C distribution. The Calc2 example
located in &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/calc2 shows how to derive
state machine classes with QP 4.x. The SLS example located in
&lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/sls shows the implemenation of the
new State-Local Storage state design pattern.


\section qpc_4_1_00 Version 4.1.00 (Product) Release date: Oct 09, 2009

The release brings a number of improvements to QP/C and updates the QP/C ARM
Cortex-M3 examples for the EK-LM3S811 board to the latest IAR EWARM 5.40.

This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the
release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications. 

The main changes in QP v4.1.00 with respect to earlier versions are as
follows:

- in qs.h added a new trace record QS_QEP_DISPATCH logged when an event is
dispatched to a state machine. This timestamped trace record marks the
beginning of an RTC step. The end of the RTC step is marked by the existing
timestamped trace records QS_QEP_INTERN_TRAN, QS_QEP_INIT_TRAN, and
QS_QEP_IGNORED, depending on how the event is handled. The new QS_QEP_DISPATCH
record facilitates measurement of the RTC step lengths.
- in qhsm_dis.c added generation of the QS_QEP_DISPATCH trace record.
- in the tools/qspy/ sub-directory added output of the new trace record to the
Q-SPY host application.
- in the tools/qspy/matlab/ sub-directory added processing of the new trace
record to the qspy.m script.
- in qpset.h changed the implementation of the Priority Set. In particular,
the QPSet64 now derives from QPSet8, which enables a common way of testing for
non-empty set (e.g., useful in assembly). Also, the findMax() functions in
QPSet8 and QPSet64 now can work with an empty set, in which case they return
0.
- in qk_sched.c simplified the QK_schedule_() function to skip the testing
of the ready-set for non-empty condition. Such test is no longer necessary.
The test can still be performed outside the QK_schedule_() function (e.g., in
assembly) to avoid calling the scheduler if the ready set is empty.
- in qk_ext.c simplified the QK_scheduleExt_() function in the same way as
QK_schedule_().
- modified make.bat files for building QP libraries in the ports/ directory
to use the externally defined environment variables for the location of the
toolchains. The defaults are applied only when the environment variable is
not defined. This enables greater flexibility in installing the development
tools in different directories than those chosen by Quantum Leaps.
- modified the ARM Cortex-M3 examples for the new IAR EWARM 5.40.
- modified slighlty the Calculator example to allow extensibility.
- in the ARM Cortex-M3 port file qk_port.s added explicit testing of the
QK_readySet_ set for empty condition. This test allows avoiding calling the QK
scheduler and two contex-switches if the ready-set is empty.
- in the game example moved setting up the QS filters from main.c to bsp.c.


\section qpc_4_0_04 Version 4.0.04 (Product) Release date: Apr 09, 2009

The maintenance release provides a fix for the compile-time assertions,
which did not work correctly for the GNU compiler family. Also, the ARM
Cortex-M3 examples have been recompiled with the newer IAR EWARM v5.30. 

This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the
release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications. 

The main changes in QP v4.0.04 with respect to earlier version are as follows:

- in qassert.h file the #Q_ASSERT_COMPILE macro has been modified to render
a negative array dimension when the asserted condition is not TRUE.


\section qpc_4_0_03 Version 4.0.03 (Product) Release date: Dec 27, 2008

The main purpose of this release is to fix a bug in the QK preemptive kernel,
which occurs only when the advanced QK features are used. Specifically, the QK
priority-ceiling mutex could interfere with QK thread-local storage (TLS) or
QK extended context switch. When the QK mutex is in use, the TLS or the
extended context for this task could get saved to an incorrect priority level.

The release 4.0.03 fixes the bug by strictly preserving the semantics of
QK_currPrio_ variable. The mutex locking now uses a different variable
QK_ceilingPrio_, which represents the ceiling-priority locked by the mutex.
The QK scheduler and extended scheduler now perform an additional check to
make sure that only tasks with priorities above the ceiling can run. To avoid
that additional overhead, the user can define the macro QK_NO_MUTEX, which
eliminates the QK mutex API and eliminates the additional tests in the QK
schedulers.

This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the
release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications. 

The main changes in QP v4.0.03 with respect to earlier version are as follows:

- in qk.h file made the QK mutex API only visible when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX
is *not* defined.
- in qk_pkg.h file, added the QK_ceilingPrio_ external declaration when the
macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.
- in qk_mutex.c file, changed priority-ceiling mutex implementation to use
the QK_ceilingPrio_ instead of QK_currPrio_. Also, added compiler error when
the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is definedthis and this file is included in the build.
- in qk_sched.c file added testing priority against the QK_ceilingPrio_,
when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.
- in qk_ext.c file added testing priority against the QK_ceilingPrio_,
when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.


\section qpc_4_0_02 Version 4.0.02 (Product) Release date: Nov 15, 2008

This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the
release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications. 

The main changes in QP v4.0.02 with respect to earlier version are as follows:

- in qep.h file, added comments to macros Q_TRAN() and Q_SUPER() to suppress
the PC-lint warining about using the comma-operator (MISRA rule 42).
- in qhsm_in.c file, fixed a bug in the QHsm_isIn() function.
- fixed a bug in tunnel.c file ("Fly 'n' Shoot" game). The constant event
HIT_WALL was not declared static.


\section qpc_4_0_01 Version 4.0.01 (Product) Release date: June 09, 2008

This maintenace release is made to allow using QS software tracing with
the GNU compiler for AVR (WinAVR). Specifically, the output of the strings
residing in ROM has been fixed.

This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the
release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications. 

The main changes in QP v4.0.01 with respect to earlier version are as follows:

- in qs_.c file, updated the function QS_str_ROM_().
- in qs_str.c file, updated the function QS_str_ROM().
- in qvanilla.c file, funciton QF_run(), declared the temporary variables
as static to save stack space, because QF_run() never returns and is not
reentrant.


\section qpc_4_0_00 Version 4.0.00 (Product) Release date: Apr 07, 2008

This milestone release is made for the book /ref PSiCC2. The book describes in
great detail this new release. The older "QP Programmer's Manual" is now
phased out and is replaced with this hyper-linked
/ref main_page "QP/C Reference Manual", which provides very detailed, easily
searchable reference to the software. The book /ref PSiCC2 provies in-depth
discussion of the relevant concepts as well as the design study of QP v4.0.

The main changes in QP v4.0 with respect to earlier versions are as follows:

- the coding techniques for hierarchical state machines (HSMs) and the simpler
finite state machines (FSMs) have changed. While the changes are quite simple,
the backward compatibility with QEP 3.x has been broken, meaning that some
manual changes to the state machines implemented with earlier versions are
necessary. Please refer to the "QP/C Tutorial" Section /ref coding_hsm for
more information about coding state machines with QEP 4.x.
    - The main change is the signature of a state-handler function, which now
    returns simply a byte. This return type (typedef'ed as QState) is the
    status of the event-handling that the state handler conveys to the QEP
    event processor.
    - The macro #Q_TRAN() must now always follow the return statement.
    - The new macro #Q_SUPER() designates the superstate of the given state.
    Again, this macro must follow the return statement.
    - Then two new macros #Q_HANDLED() and #Q_IGNORED() have been added to
    return the status of event handled and event ignored, respectively.

- all callback functions are now consistently called /c #XXX_onYYY():
    - Q_assert_handler() is now Q_onAssert()
    - QF_start() is now QF_onStartup()
    - QF_cleanup() is now QF_onCleanup()

- the new header file qevent.h has been broken off the qep.h header file.
qevent.h contains the QEvent class and other basic facilities used in the
whole QP. This new file allows easier replacement of the entire QEP event
processor with custom event processors, if you wish do so.
- the macro QEP_SIGNAL_SIZE is renamed to #Q_SIGNAL_SIZE.
- the data type QSTATE is now deprecated. Please use QState.
- the "protected" in C don't no longer have the trailing underscore. For
example, QHsm_ctor_() is replaced with #QHsm_ctor(), etc.
- the #QF_FSM_ACTIVE macro is now deprecated. Instead, you have the family of
macros #QF_ACTIVE_SUPER_, #QF_ACTIVE_CTOR_, #QF_ACTIVE_INIT_,
#QF_ACTIVE_DISPATCH_, #QF_ACTIVE_STATE_, which allow replacing the base class
for active objects in QF. By default, these macros are defined to use the QHsm
class from the QEP hierarchical event processor, but you can replace the event
processor, if you wish.
- the internal macro QACTIVE_OSOBJECT_WAIT_() is now #QACTIVE_EQUEUE_WAIT_().
- the internal macro QACTIVE_OSOBJECT_SIGNAL_() is now
#QACTIVE_EQUEUE_SIGNAL_().
- the internal macro QACTIVE_OSOBJECT_ONIDLE_() is now
#QACTIVE_EQUEUE_ONEMPTY_().
- the data mebers QActive.osObject and QActive.thread are now present only if
the macros #QF_OS_OBJECT_TYPE and #QF_THREAD_TYPE are defined.
- the QPSet class has been renamed to QPSet64.
- the QPSet_hasElements() has been renamed QPSet64_notEmpty()
- the QS software tracing is now better integrated with all QP components. You
no longer need to explicitly include qs_port.h, because it is automatically
included when you define the macro #Q_SPY. Also the file qs_dummy.h is
included automatically when the macro #Q_SPY is <STRONG>not</STRONG> defined.
- the new header file qvanilla.h now replaces the file qsched.h.
- the file qa_ctor.c is now obsolete.
- the macros QF_SCHED_LOCK() and QF_SCHED_UNLOCK() are now obsolete.
- the native QF event queues (both the active object event queues and the
"raw" thread-safe queues) are slightly more efficient by counting down the
head and tail pointers rather than up. This leads to wrap-around at zero,
which is easier (faster) to test than any other wrap-around point. Also the
native QF event queues maintain the minimum of the free events in the queue
rather the maximum of used events.
- the data member of QEQueue.nTot class is removed.
- the QF_publish() function has been re-written so that QF no does <STRONG>not
need to lock the scheduler</STRONG>. The QF_publish() function posts events
to active objects with scheduler unlocked starting from the highest-priority
active objects. However, the event is protected from inadvertent recycling by
incrementing its reference counter before the publish operation. After the
event  is posted to all subscribers, the garbage collector QF_gc() is called
to decrement the reference counter and recycle the event, if necessary.
- the qf_run.c file is obsolete. The QF_run() function for the cooperative
"vanilla" kernel is now implemented in the file qvanilla.c.
- the QF_tick() function has been rewritten to allow calling QF_tick() from 
the task context as well as from the interrupt context. The nested critical
section around QF_tick() is no longer needed when it is called from the task
level. Among others, this re-design <STRONG>eliminates the need for the 
recursive</STRONG> mutex in the POSIX QF port.
- the QMPool_init() function has been re-designed to optimally align the
memory buffer in a portable and platform-independent way. This should bring
some performance improvements on some CPUs (e.g., 80x86).
- the extended QK scheduler has been re-designed to save stack space. The
extended context (e.g., coprocessor registers) are no longer saved on the
precious stack, but rather in the active object.
- a bug has been fixed in handling of Thread-Local Storage (TLS) in the QK
scheduler and extended scheduler.

- the -q (quiet) flag has been added to the QSPY host application.
- the support for two new compilers for Windows has been added for the QSPY
host application. The application can now be build with the MinGW GNU compiler
for Windows as well as the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.

- the QP port to Linux has been improved by eliminating the need for recursive
P-Thread mutex.

- the QP port to MicroC/OS-II has been upgraded to the latest version 2.86.

- all examples in the standard QP distribution have been cleaned up and
updated to the latest QP API changes.
- all examples that use QF now contain the QS software tracing support.
  

\section qpc_3_4_01 Version 3.4.01 (Product)
Release date: Sep 25, 2007

This product release adds the backward-compatibility layer so that previous
QP/C ports continue to work with the new version.

This product release also comes with the updated "QP Programmer's Manual",
which now includes the QS target component and the QSpy host application.


\section qpc_3_4_00 Version 3.4.00 (Beta)
Release date: Sep 03, 2007

This release brings several changes with the overall goal of simplifying and
improving consistency across the whole QP family of frameworks (QP/C, QP/C++,
and QP-nano).

This release includes simplifying of the C naming conventions (see the
updated Application Note <a
href="http://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_QL_Coding_Standard.pdf">"QL C/C++
Coding Standard"</a>). The double-underscore suffix for private data members
of structures is no longer used. Single underscore is used still only for
internal QP/C facilities that typically should not be used by the application
programmer.

The main changes are made to the QEP component. The "static transition
optimization" has been removed altogether. This simplifies significantly the
state machine structure (which now contains just the currently active state).
Also, the efficiency is improved for processing the dynamic transitions and
the stack usage is lower. This change brings the QEP/C implementation much
closer to QEP-nano.

The other big change in this release is including the Quantum Spy (QS)
component in the distribution. Previously, the QS component was available only
under the commercial licensing. It is now open source, just as the rest of QP.

In, the QF/C component, the QTimerEvt_publishIn() and QTimeEvt_publishEvery()
have been removed, because they introduced a coupling between time events and
publish-subscribe. This is undesirable for projects that do not want to
include the publish-subscribe facilty.

Finally, the revision history for individual QP/C components has been moved
from the header files and is now consolidated in the header file
doxygen/qpc_rev.h.


\section qpc_3_3_01 Version 3.3.01 (Product)
Release date: Mar 17, 2007

The main change in this release is removing the 'const' declaration
of two temporary variables inside QHsm_dispatch() and QHsm_tran() functions.
This was necessary to compile the code with the MPLAB C18 compiler for PIC18
devices.

Other minor changes include adding the 'U' suffix (unsigned) to several
numerical literals to avoid MPLAB C18 compiler warnings.

The changes in release 3.3.01 have NO impact on the existing QP/C ports.

-# in file qhsm_dis.c:80 removed 'const' from the declaration of '*c'.
-# in file qhsm_tra.c:69 removed 'const' from the declaration of 'src'.
-# in file qep.c changed the version number to "3.3.01".
-# added the 'U' suffix to several numerical literals in files:
qa_defer.c, qa_usuba.c, qf_gc.c, qf_pool.c, qf_run.c
-# in file qf_act.c changed the version number to "3.3.01".
-# added the cast to (uint8_t) to several numerical literals in the file qk.c.
-# in file qk.c changed the version number to "3.3.01".
-# added the 'U' suffix to several numerical literals in file qs.h.
-# in files qs_.c and qs_str.c added explicit casting to (char const).
-# in file qs.c changed the version number to "3.3.01".


\section qpc_3_3_00 Version 3.3.00 (Product)
Release date: Jan 22, 2007

The main change in this release is removing #include <stdint.h> from the
qep.h header file. This has been done becasue vast majority of embedded
compilers for small MCUs actually do not provide the C-99 Standard header
file <stdint.h>. Worse, compilers such as Freescale HC(S)08 C/C++ compiler
will not include <stdint.h> unless it's in the compilers's include directory,
even though the "stdint.h" file might be in the compiler include path.

Removing the "#include <stdint.h>" from qep.h header file allows more
flexibility in the way the standard exact-width integer types are defined.
For compilers that do not provide the <stdint.h> file, you provide the
typedef's in the qpc_port.h file before including qep.h. For compilers
that do provide the <stdint.h> header file, you simply include this file
in the qpc_port.h header file before including qep.h.

The changes in release 3.3.00 have impact on all QP ports, because you need
to modify the qpc_port.h file in all these ports.

The other significant change in this release is adding the macro #Q_ROM_VAR
for all constant objects allocated in ROM. The #Q_ROM_VAR macro has been
added for the compilers like Freescale HC(S)08, which require far pointers
to access the objects in ROM. Please note that specifying the pointer size
for accessing a ROM objects is syntactically different than specifying
that the object is allocated in ROM (see macro #Q_ROM).

Finally, in release 3.3.00 the build strategy for QP ports has been
simplified as well. Instead of separate Makefile for every QP component,
such as QEP, QF, QK, and QS, not the "ports" directory contains a batch
file "make.bat" that builds all the libraries at once.


-# in file qep.h removed "#include <stdint.h>".
-# in file qassert.h added macro #Q_ROM_VAR for objects allocated in ROM
and to signatures of functions accessing these objects.

\section qpc_3_2_05 Version 3.2.05 (Product)
Release date: Dec 08, 2006

This QF release rolls back the changes made to the reference-counting
policy. The reference count of a dynamic event is incremented
when the event is posted, but is NOT decremented when the event is
retreived from the queue. The reference count is decremented only later,
in the garbage collector (QF_gc()).

This release adds direct support for event deferral (the "Deferred Event"
state pattern) through methods QActive_defer_() and QActive_recall_().

Also this release adapts the QS code to the specifics of
the Keil C51 compiler for 8051/251. In particular, the C51 compiler treats
the identifier "data" as an extended keyword. To make the QS code compile
with C51, all "data" used as a formal function parameter have been renamed.
Additionally, this release fixes a minor bug in the #QS_FUN_DICTIONARY macro.

-# In file qf.h added methods QActive_defer_() and QActive_recall_().
-# In file qa_get_.c removed decrementing the reference count of a
dynamic event.
-# In file qeq_get.c removed decrementing the reference count of a
dynamic event.
-# In file qf_gc.cpp restored decrementing of the reference count of a
dynamic event.
-# Added new file qa_defer.c that implements QActive_defer_() and
QActive_recall_().
-# In file qf_act.c updated version number to 3.2.05
-# In file qs.h removed all instances of indentifier "data"
-# In file qs.h fixed a bug in the definition of macro #QS_FUN_DICTIONARY.
-# In file qs_.c renamed all instances of identifier "data".
-# In file qs_f32.c renamed all instances of identifier "data".
-# In file qs_f64.c renamed all instances of identifier "data".
-# In file qs.c, in functions QS_filterOn() and QS_filterOff() moved the
declaration of the temporary variable 'i' from the inner scope to the
function scope. The C51 compiler was crushing with variables at inner scope.
-# In file qs.c updated version number to 3.2.05
-# Updated the "QP Programmer's Manaul" to Revision D


\section qpc_3_2_04 Version 3.2.04 (Beta)
Release date: Dec 01, 2006

This QF release changes the internal policy of reference-counting for
dynamic events. The reference count of a dynamic event is now incremented
when the event is posted to a queue and decremented when the event is
later retreived from the queue. This policy pertains to both active
object queues and native QF thread-safe queues (QEQueue).

Previously, the reference count of a dynamic event was not decremented
upon retreival of the event from the event queue, but rather in the
garbage collector (QF_gc()).

This QK release adds two new features in QK.

The first feature added is the extended context switch for CPUs with
co-processors, such as the x87 FPU accompanying the x86 CPU. As a fully-
preemptive kernel, QK needs to save and restore the context of the co-
processor accrosss the asynchronous preemption. This QK release adds
a generic mechanism for saving and restoring extened context in the
extended scheduler (QK_scheduleExt_()), which is used only at the
exit from the interrupts (asynchronous preemptions).

The second feature added is the Thread-Local Storage (TLS) for reentrant
libraries, such as the NewLib. This feature allows assigning per-thread
memory and providing a hook (callback) activated at every context switch.

-# In file qf.h eliminated methods QActive_postFIFO_() and
QActive_postLIFO_().
-# In file qf.h changed method QActive_get__() to QActive_get_() (protected
scope) to make it available to various thread-run routines.
-# In file qa_fifo.c changed the implementation of QActive_postFIFO()
to represent the native QF event queue of an active object.
-# In file qa_fifo_.c removed the implementation of QActive_postFIFO__()
and declared the file obsolete (will be removed in future releases).
-# In file qa_lifo.c changed the implementation of QActive_postLIFO()
to represent the native QF event queue of an active object.
-# In file qa_lifo_.c removed the implementation of QActive_postLIFO__()
and declared the file obsolete (will be removed in future releases).
-# In file qa_get_.cpp added decrementing the reference count of a
dynamic event.
-# In file qf_gc.c removed decrementing of the reference count of a
dynamic event. Also changed the test for recycling an event (reference
count of zero).
-# In file qf_pspub.c removed incrementing the reference count of a
dynamic event.
-# Removed all uses of the macros #QACTIVE_POST_FIFO_, #QACTIVE_POST_LIFO_,
and QACTIVE_GET_. These macros are made now obsolete.
-# In file qsched.h removed definitions of the obsolete macros
#QACTIVE_POST_FIFO_, #QACTIVE_POST_LIFO_, and QACTIVE_GET_.
-# In file qf_pspub.c replaced the macro QACTIVE_POST_FIFO_() with the direct
call to the function QActive_postFIFO(QF_active_[p], e).
-# In file qf_tick.c replaced the macro QACTIVE_POST_FIFO_() with the direct
call to the function QActive_postFIFO(QF_active_[p], e).
-# Changed the uC/OS-II port to reflect new policy of handling reference
counters inside the dynamic events. Also removed files qa_fifo.c and
qa_lifo.c from the uC/OS-II build.
-# In file qf_act.c updated version number to 3.2.04
-# In file qk.h updated revision history and added the prototype for the
extended scheduler QK_scheduleExt_(). This scheduler implements the
generic extended context via macros #QK_EXT_TYPE, #QK_EXT_SAVE, and
#QK_EXT_RESTORE.
-# In file qk.h removed definitions of the obsolete macros
#QACTIVE_POST_FIFO_, #QACTIVE_POST_LIFO_, and QACTIVE_GET_.
-# In file qk_sched.c added logic for handling the TLS via the macro
#QK_TLS.
-# Added new file qk_ext.c with the definition of the extended scheduler
QK_scheduleExt_().
-# Added the file qk_ext.c to the Makefile for QK port to 80x86 with
Turbo C++ 1.01.
-# Extended the QK port to 80x86 with Turbo C++ 1.01 to handle the
x87 FPU context.
-# Extended the QDPP example for QK with Turbo C++ 1.01 to demonstrate
threads that use the FPU and require the extended context switch.
-# In file qk.c updated version number to 3.2.04
-# Updated the "QP Programmer's Manaul" to Revision C


\section qpc_3_2_03 Version 3.2.03 (Product)
Release date: Nov 15, 2006

The main purpose of this release is to adapt the code to the shortcomings of
the gcc compiler for handling data in program ROM for Harvard architecture
CPUs, such as the Atmel's AVR or the 8051. In such machines, the data space
(RAM) and program space (ROM) are accessed with different instructions.
The gcc compiler does not automatically synthesize the correct code for
accessing data placed in the program ROM, even though
__attribute__((__progmem__)) is used. The workaround for the gcc is to add
special assembly instructions to transfer the data from the program space to
the data space. This version of QP/C adds macros for each data element
allocated to the program space (delcared with the Q_ROM attribute). Please
note that commercial compilers, such as IAR, handle data allocated in the
program space (ROM) correctly and do not need any workarounds.

This release also fixes a few minor inconsistencies in the code (see the list
below):/

-# In file qf.h added default definition of macro #Q_ROM_BYTE
-# In file qf_set.h added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the lookup tables
allocated in ROM (several places).
-# In file qf_sched.h changed types QF_OS_OBJECT_TYPE and QF_THREAD_TYPE to
uint8_t from int8_t
-# In file qs_dummy.h added dummy definitions of some missing QS macros
-# In file qa_sub.c added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the lookup tables
allocated in ROM (several places).
-# In file qa_usub.c added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the lookup tables
allocated in ROM (several places).
-# In file qf_usuba.c added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the lookup tables
allocated in ROM (several places).
-# In file qf_pspub.c added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the lookup tables
allocated in ROM (several places).
-# In file qf_act.c updated version number to 3.2.03
-# In file qs_pkg.h added default definition of macro #Q_ROM_BYTE
-# In file qa_sub.c added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the lookup tables
allocated in ROM (several places).
-# In file qs_.c added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the string allocated in ROM
-# In file qs_str.c added macro #Q_ROM_BYTE to access the string allocated
in ROM.
-# In file qs.h changed the include file name from "qs_dummy" to "qs_dummy.h".
-# In file qs.c updated version number to 3.2.03

\section qpc_3_2_00 Version 3.2.00 (Product)
Release date: Aug 07, 2006

-# In file qep.h added the default definition of Q_ROM in case it's not
defined by the user.
-# In file qassert.h added the macro Q_ROM to allocate constant strings
to ROM.
-# In file qep.c updated version number to 3.2.00
-# Updated the "QEP/C Programmer's Manual".
-# In file qf.h changed the semantics of the QF_onIdle() callback.
This callback is now invoked with interrupts LOCKED from the non-preemptive
scheduler used in the "vanilla" QF ports to "bare metal" target boards.<br>
<br>
The modification changes the responsibilities of QF_onIdle(), which now MUST
at least unlock interrupts. A failure to unlock interrupts in QF_onIdle()
will leave the interrupts locked all the time and would prevent the
application from running.<br>
<br>
Also, the signature of QF_onIdle() now depends on the interrupt locking
policy. In case of the "save and restore interrupt status" policy, the
QF_onIdle() callback takes the interrupt lock key as parameter (to be able
to unlock the interrups correctly).
-# In file qf.h used the macro Q_ROM to allocate constant objects
to ROM (/sa qep.h). Objects allocated to ROM are: the version strings, and
the lookup tables (QF_log2Lkup[], QF_pwr2Lkup[], QF_invPwr2Lkup, and
QF_div8Lkup[].
-# Added new platform-independent header file qsched.h to provide the
interface to the simple non-preemptive scheduler used in the "vanilla" ports
of QF to "bare metal" targets. This header file is only applicable to the
"vanilla" ports.
-# Added new platform-independent implementation file qf_run.c to
implement the simple non-preemptive scheduler used in the "vanilla" ports
of QF to "bare metal" targets. This implementation file eliminates the need
for qf_port.c file in the "vanilla" ports of QF. Also, the qf_run.c module
should only be placed in the QF library in the vanilla QF ports.
-# Simplified all "vanilla" ports of QF to use the common platform-
independent implementation provided in qf_run.c.
-# Updated QF_onIdle() callback in all examples of "vanilla" ports of QF to
unlock interrupts.
-# Modified file qf_pspub.c to allow allocating a temporary stack variable
inside the macro QF_SCHED_LOCK(). This change is related to modification in
QK v 3.2.00.
-# Updated the "QF/C Programmer's Manual".
-# in file qk.h added new idle callback QK_onIdle(), which in contrast
to QF_onIdle() is invoked with interrupts unlocked.
-# in file qk.h removed QK_schedLock()/QK_schedUnlock() and replaced them
with QK_mutexLock()/QK_mutexUnlock(), with the semantics of returning the
mutex.
-# in file qk.h changed the definitions of macros #QF_SCHED_LOCK/
#QF_SCHED_UNLOCK to use the new QK mutex API.
-# In file qk.h used the macro Q_ROM to allocate constant objects
to ROM (/sa qep.h).
-# in file qk.h added the typedef for QMutex.
-# in file qk.c replaced the callback QF_onIdle() with the new one
QK_onIdle().
-# removed source file qk_lock.c
-# added source file qk_mutex.c
-# in file qk.c changed the version number to 3.2.00
-# Updated "QK/C Programmer's Manual"
-# In file qs.h replaced QS_QK_SCHED_LOCK/UNLOCK with QS_QK_MUTEX_LOCK/UNLOCK.
Also, changed data accompanying the trace records QS_QK_MUTEX_LOCK/UNLOCK.
-# In file qs.h used the macro Q_ROM to allocate constant objects
to ROM (/sa qep.h).
-# in file qs.c changed the version number to 3.2.00
-# Updated "QS/C Programmer's Manual" in PDF.

code to stop the framework.
-# In file qf.h added callback function QF_cleanup() to be called from the
QF port to cleanup before exiting to the OS.
-# In file qf.h deprecated the function QF_exit().

\section qpc_3_0_10 Version 3.0.10 (Beta)
Release date: Aug 06, 2005

This release contains completely redesigned Quantum Event Processor (QEP). The
main focus is on compliance with standards (MISRA, Lint, Coding Standard),
better portability, stack-use efficiency.

-# This release includes a comprehensive "QEP/C v3.0 Programmer's Manual"
in PDF.
-# This release contains in-source comments for automatic generation of
this Reference Manual with <A HREF="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen</A>.
-# This release includes re-packaging the code into much larger number of
modules (.c files) with typically one function per module. This
fine-granularity packaging allows for better automatic elimination of unused
code at link time and fine-tuning by applying different compiler options to
different files.
-# This release is 98% compliant with the Motor Industry Software Reliability
Association (MISRA) "Guidelines for the Use of the C Language in Vehicle Based
Software", April 1998, ISBN 0-9524156-9-0 (see also See also
http://www.misra.org.uk). A separate Application Note "QEP/C MISRA Compliance
Matrix" contains detailed account how QEP/C compiles with the 127 MISRA rules
(See http://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_QP_C_MISRA.pdf).
-# This release is now "lint-free". The source code has been thoroughly checked with the latest version of PC-lint(TM) (version 8.00q) from Gimpel Software (www.gimpel.com). The PC-lint configuration files and output files are included in the distribution. A separate Application Note "QEP/C PC-Lint Compliance" contains detailed account how QEP/C compiles with PC-Lint. (See
http://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_QP_C_PC-Lint.pdf).
-# This release is compliant with the "Quantum Leaps Coding C/C++ Standard"
(http://www.state-machine.com/resources/QL_coding_standard.pdf). Among others,
all public names are prefixed by "Q_", or "QEP_" to minimize compile-time and
link-time name conflicts. In addition, QEP/C uses the C99 standard include
file <stdint.h> (C99 Standard, Section 7.18). Pre-standard compilers are still
supported by placing <stdint.h> in the compiler's header file directory.
-# The QEvent structure has been redesigned to use memory more efficiently.
QEvent takes up only 2 bytes now.
-# The QHsm structure now derives from the
QFsm structure, which promotes better code re-use. In particular, macros
Q_INIT() and Q_TRAN() are now common for both traditional non-hierarchical
FSMs and for HSMs.
-# The QFsm class has been redesigned to allow using entry
and exit actions. Now the QFsm class strictly avoids recursion, just as QHsm
does (MISRA rule 70).
-# The QPseudoState type has been eliminated and
replaced by QState.
-# The central QHsm class in QEP has been completely
redesigned. The basic transition algorithm is essentially the same as
described in "PSiCC", however the implementation is very different. The
redesign was necessary to comply with the MISRA rules and to eliminate Lint
warnings.
-# The event processor is now strictly non-recursive (MISRA rule
70), that is, event handlers never call themselves, even indirectly. (Previous
algorithm required one-level of indirect recursion.)
-# Dynamic state
transition is now default. Static transition optimization is still supported,
but considered optional for performance tuning.
-# The artificial limitation
of initial transitions targeting only immediate substate of a composite state
has been removed (see "PSiCC" Figure 5.4[a]). Initial transitions can now
target any substate, arbitrarily nested within the composite state.
-# This
distribution uses the legacy Borland Turbo C++ 1.01 as the default compiler.
Port to DOS with Turbo C++ 1.01 is provided along with GNU-compatible
makefiles for the QEP library and sample applications. This compiler is not
C99-compliant and does not provide the <stdint.h> header file. However, the
port of QEP includes a minimal <stdint.h>, which should be placed into the
INCLUDE directory of the Borland Turbo C++ 1.01 installation.
-# This
distribution contains three sample applications: A simple time bomb (QBomb) to
demonstrate use of QFsm, a calculator (QCalc), and an exhaustive test of the
QHsm class (QHsmTst). All examples are implemented as text-only application
compiled with Turbo C++ 1.01. The QHsmTst sample application supports
interactive and batch mode for exhaustive testing of the event processor. The
source code for QHsmTst demonstrates also how QEP/C application code can be
MISRA-compliant.
-# This distribution contains make files for the Turbo C++
1.01 make utility, as well as GNU-compatible Makefiles.
