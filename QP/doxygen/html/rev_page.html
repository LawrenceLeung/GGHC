Version 4.1.07 (Product) Release date: Feb 28, 2011</h2>
<p>The goal of this release is to improve the ease of experimenting with QP/C on the desktop. This release adds support for Windows (Win32) to the baseline code. Two most popular compilers for Windows are supported: Microsoft Visual Studio and MinGW (GNU). The support for Linux has been improved by including pre-built QP/C libraries and improving makefiles for Eclipse compatibility.</p>
<p>The changes in detail are:</p>
<p>1. Added Win32 port with the Visual C++ 2008 (ports/80x86/win32/vc2008). This directory contains the Visual Studio solution all_qp.sln for building all QP/C libraries from the IDE. Three build configurations (Debug, Release, and Spy) are supported.</p>
<p>2. Added Win32 port with the MinGW comiler (ports/80x86/win32/mingw). This directory contains the Makefile for building all QP/C libraries. Three build configurations (dbg, rel, and spy) are supported. NOTE: the Makefile assumes that the MinGW/bin directory is added to the PATH.</p>
<p>3. Added Win32 examples for Visual C++ 2008 (examples/80x86/win32/ vc2008/dpp and examples/80x86/win32/vc2008/qhsmtst). Visual Studio soultions are provides for all build configurations.</p>
<p>4. Added Win32 examples for MinGW (examples/80x86/win32/mingw/dpp and examples/80x86/win32/mingw/qhsmtst). Eclipse-compatible makefiles are provided for all build configurations. NOTE: the Makefiles assume that the MinGW/bin directory is added to the PATH.</p>
<p>5. Removed memory alignment correction in the file <a class="el" href="qmp__init_8c.html" title="QMPool_init() implementation.">qmp_init.c</a>. This correction required casting of pointers to integers and was problematic on 64-bit targets (such as 64-bit Linux).</p>
<p>6. Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with CodeSourcery to the latest Sourcery G++ 2011.02-2.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_06"></a>
Version 4.1.06 (Product) Release date: Jan 07, 2011</h2>
<p>1. Made cosmetic improvements to the example QM models of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game.</p>
<p>2. Made improvements in make.bat files for building the examples for DOS/Open Watcom to run better in DosBox on Linux.</p>
<p>3. Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with IAR to the latest IAR EWARM version 6.10.</p>
<p>4. Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with CodeSourcery to the latest Sourcery G++ 2010.09-66.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_05"></a>
Version 4.1.05 (Product) Release date: Nov 01, 2010</h2>
<p>This release is adds examples for the QM (QP Modeler) graphical modeling and code generation tool. The examples are based on the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game described in the QP/C Tutorial and in Chapter 1 of the PSiCC2 book.</p>
<p>Specifically, the directory &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/game-qm/ contains the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game model file "game.qm". This model, when opened in the QM tool contains all state machine diagrams and generates code into the subdirectory qm_code/. This code can then be built and executed on any 80x86 machine (newer versions of Windows or Linux require the DOSbox application, see <a href="http://www.dosbox.com">http://www.dosbox.com</a>).</p>
<p>The directory &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/arm-cortex/vanilla/iar/game-ev-lm3s811-qm/ contains the version of the game for the EV-LM3S811 ARM Cortex-M3 board. This directory contains the model file "game.qm", which is actually identical as the model in the DOS version. The LM3S811 version needs to be compiled with the IAR compiler and executed on the EV-LM3S811 board.</p>
<p>Additionally, the QP/C baseline code has been slighlty modified for better conformance to the MISRA C 2004 rules and the latest PC-Lint 9.x.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_04"></a>
Version 4.1.04 (Product) Release date: Mar 16, 2010</h2>
<p>This release is adds compatibility of all examples for DOS with the DOSBox emulator (<a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">http://www.dosbox.com/</a>) that recreates a MS-DOS compatible environment on all versions of Windows, including 64-bit Windows that don't run 16-bit DOS applications anymore.</p>
<p>Also, this release includes QP ports and examples for EV-LM3S811 board with the GNU-based Code Sourcery G++ toolset. Support for Sourcery G++ provides a very cost-effective option for developing QP applications for ARM Cortex MCUs.</p>
<p>Finally, this release improves the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) for the whole family of the Stellaris LM3Sxxx MCUs. The improvement extends the CMSIS from Sandstorm to Fury, DustDevil, and Tempest Stellaris families.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_03"></a>
Version 4.1.03 (Product) Release date: Jan 21, 2010</h2>
<p>This release is concerned with the ARM Cortex ports and examples. Specifically, this release contains the following improvements:</p>
<p>1. Unified source code for ARM Cortex-M3 and the new ARM Cortex-M0 cores, including the code for the preemptive QK kernel.</p>
<p>2. Compliance with the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) in all ARM Cortex examples.</p>
<p>3. Backward-compatible support for the new LM3S811 EVAL Rev C board with different OLED display than previous revisions. (NOTE: The OSRAM 96x16x1 OLED used in REV A-B boards has been replaced RITEK 96x16x1 OLED used in Rev C.)</p>
<p>In the process of making the examples CMSIS-compliant, the dependency on the Luminary Micro driver library (driverlib.a) has been completely removed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the screen saver of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game has been improved to periodically switch off the power of the OLED display, which better protects the display from burn-in. The affected file is tunnel.c.</p>
<p>Finally, this release introduces the QP_VERSION macro, which identifies the QP version. Otherwise, this maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications except for the ARM Cortex ports and applications.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_02"></a>
Version 4.1.02 (Product) Release date: Jan 14, 2010</h2>
<p>The purpose of this minor maintenance release is the change in the directory structure for the ARM Cortex ports and examples. As new ARM Cortex cores are becoming available, the old port name "cortex-m3" could be misleading, because it actually applies to wider range of ARM Cortex cores. Consequently, all ARM Cortex ports and examples are hosted in the directory tree called "arm-cortex".</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications except for the ARM Cortex ports and applications.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_01"></a>
Version 4.1.01 (Product) Release date: Nov 05, 2009</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to replace the Turbo C++ 1.01 toolset with the Open Watcom C/C++ toolset, because Turbo C++ 1.01 is no longer available for a free download. In contrast, Open Watcom is distributed under an OSI-certified open source license, which permits free commercial and non-commercial use. Open Watcom can be downloaded from www.openwatcom.org.</p>
<p>All 80x86/DOS, 80x86/qk, and 80x86/ucos2 ports and examples for Turbo C++ 1.01 have been replaced with ports and examples for Open Watcom. The make.bat scripts are provided to build the QP/C libraries and examples.</p>
<p>In the process of converting the examples to Open Watcom two new examples have been added to the standard QP/C distribution. The Calc2 example located in &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/calc2 shows how to derive state machine classes with QP 4.x. The SLS example located in &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/sls shows the implemenation of the new State-Local Storage state design pattern.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_00"></a>
Version 4.1.00 (Product) Release date: Oct 09, 2009</h2>
<p>The release brings a number of improvements to QP/C and updates the QP/C ARM Cortex-M3 examples for the EK-LM3S811 board to the latest IAR EWARM 5.40.</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.1.00 with respect to earlier versions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a> added a new trace record QS_QEP_DISPATCH logged when an event is dispatched to a state machine. This timestamped trace record marks the beginning of an RTC step. The end of the RTC step is marked by the existing timestamped trace records QS_QEP_INTERN_TRAN, QS_QEP_INIT_TRAN, and QS_QEP_IGNORED, depending on how the event is handled. The new QS_QEP_DISPATCH record facilitates measurement of the RTC step lengths.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qhsm__dis_8c.html" title="QHsm_dispatch() implementation.">qhsm_dis.c</a> added generation of the QS_QEP_DISPATCH trace record.</li>
<li>in the tools/qspy/ sub-directory added output of the new trace record to the Q-SPY host application.</li>
<li>in the tools/qspy/matlab/ sub-directory added processing of the new trace record to the qspy.m script.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qpset_8h.html" title="platform-independent priority sets of 8 or 64 elements.">qpset.h</a> changed the implementation of the Priority Set. In particular, the <a class="el" href="struct_q_p_set64.html" title="Priority Set of up to 64 elements for building various schedulers.">QPSet64</a> now derives from <a class="el" href="struct_q_p_set8.html" title="Priority Set of up to 8 elements for building various schedulers.">QPSet8</a>, which enables a common way of testing for non-empty set (e.g., useful in assembly). Also, the findMax() functions in <a class="el" href="struct_q_p_set8.html" title="Priority Set of up to 8 elements for building various schedulers.">QPSet8</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_p_set64.html" title="Priority Set of up to 64 elements for building various schedulers.">QPSet64</a> now can work with an empty set, in which case they return 0.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk__sched_8c.html" title="QK_schedule_() implementation.">qk_sched.c</a> simplified the QK_schedule_() function to skip the testing of the ready-set for non-empty condition. Such test is no longer necessary. The test can still be performed outside the QK_schedule_() function (e.g., in assembly) to avoid calling the scheduler if the ready set is empty.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk__ext_8c.html" title="QK_scheduleExt_() implementation.">qk_ext.c</a> simplified the QK_scheduleExt_() function in the same way as QK_schedule_().</li>
<li>modified make.bat files for building QP libraries in the ports/ directory to use the externally defined environment variables for the location of the toolchains. The defaults are applied only when the environment variable is not defined. This enables greater flexibility in installing the development tools in different directories than those chosen by Quantum Leaps.</li>
<li>modified the ARM Cortex-M3 examples for the new IAR EWARM 5.40.</li>
<li>modified slighlty the Calculator example to allow extensibility.</li>
<li>in the ARM Cortex-M3 port file qk_port.s added explicit testing of the QK_readySet_ set for empty condition. This test allows avoiding calling the QK scheduler and two contex-switches if the ready-set is empty.</li>
<li>in the game example moved setting up the QS filters from main.c to bsp.c.</li>
</ul>

Version 4.0.04 (Product) Release date: Apr 09, 2009</h2>
<p>The maintenance release provides a fix for the compile-time assertions, which did not work correctly for the GNU compiler family. Also, the ARM Cortex-M3 examples have been recompiled with the newer IAR EWARM v5.30.</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0.04 with respect to earlier version are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qassert_8h.html" title="Customizable QP assertions.">qassert.h</a> file the <a class="el" href="qassert_8h.html#a17f551ed8492f013d533f27353c091a3">Q_ASSERT_COMPILE</a> macro has been modified to render a negative array dimension when the asserted condition is not TRUE.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_0_03"></a>
Version 4.0.03 (Product) Release date: Dec 27, 2008</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to fix a bug in the QK preemptive kernel, which occurs only when the advanced QK features are used. Specifically, the QK priority-ceiling mutex could interfere with QK thread-local storage (TLS) or QK extended context switch. When the QK mutex is in use, the TLS or the extended context for this task could get saved to an incorrect priority level.</p>
<p>The release 4.0.03 fixes the bug by strictly preserving the semantics of QK_currPrio_ variable. The mutex locking now uses a different variable QK_ceilingPrio_, which represents the ceiling-priority locked by the mutex. The QK scheduler and extended scheduler now perform an additional check to make sure that only tasks with priorities above the ceiling can run. To avoid that additional overhead, the user can define the macro QK_NO_MUTEX, which eliminates the QK mutex API and eliminates the additional tests in the QK schedulers.</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0.03 with respect to earlier version are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk_8h.html" title="QK/C platform-independent public interface.">qk.h</a> file made the QK mutex API only visible when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is *not* defined.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk__pkg_8h.html" title="Internal (package scope) QK/C interface.">qk_pkg.h</a> file, added the QK_ceilingPrio_ external declaration when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk__mutex_8c.html" title="QK_mutexLock()/QK_mutexUnlock() implementation.">qk_mutex.c</a> file, changed priority-ceiling mutex implementation to use the QK_ceilingPrio_ instead of QK_currPrio_. Also, added compiler error when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is definedthis and this file is included in the build.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk__sched_8c.html" title="QK_schedule_() implementation.">qk_sched.c</a> file added testing priority against the QK_ceilingPrio_, when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.</li>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk__ext_8c.html" title="QK_scheduleExt_() implementation.">qk_ext.c</a> file added testing priority against the QK_ceilingPrio_, when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.</li>
</ul>

Version 4.0.02 (Product) Release date: Nov 15, 2008</h2>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0.02 with respect to earlier version are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html" title="Public QEP/C interface.">qep.h</a> file, added comments to macros <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#a8f06cd90ba5060780fc61a4810e3eb50" title="Designates a target for an initial or regular transition.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_0_01"></a>
Version 4.0.01 (Product) Release date: June 09, 2008</h2>
<p>This maintenace release is made to allow using QS software tracing with the GNU compiler for AVR (WinAVR). Specifically, the output of the strings residing in ROM has been fixed.</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_0_00"></a>
Version 4.0.00 (Product) Release date: Apr 07, 2008</h2>
<p>This milestone release is made for the book /ref PSiCC2. The book describes in great detail this new release. The older "QP Programmer's Manual" is now phased out and is replaced with this hyper-linked /ref main_page "QP/C Reference Manual", which provides very detailed, easily searchable reference to the software. The book /ref PSiCC2 provies in-depth discussion of the relevant concepts as well as the design study of QP v4.0.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0 with respect to earlier versions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the coding techniques for hierarchical state machines (HSMs) and the simpler finite state machines (FSMs) have changed. While the changes are quite simple, the backward compatibility with QEP 3.x has been broken, meaning that some manual changes to the state machines implemented with earlier versions are necessary. Please refer to the "QP/C Tutorial" Section /ref coding_hsm for more information about coding state machines with QEP 4.x.<ul>
<li>The main change is the signature of a state-handler function, which now returns simply a byte. This return type (typedef'ed as QState) is the status of the event-handling that the state handler conveys to the QEP event processor.</li>
<li>The macro <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#a8f06cd90ba5060780fc61a4810e3eb50" title="Designates a target for an initial or regular transition. Q_TRAN() can be used both in the FSMs and H...">Q_TRAN()</a> must now always follow the return statement.</li>
<li>The new macro <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#ad8abd2f7098c41ec464343d9d8f1eadc" title="Designates the superstate of a given state in an HSM.">Q_SUPER()</a> designates the superstate of the given state. Again, this macro must follow the return statement.</li>
<li>Then two new macros <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#a54b2da5e70ef983cfa7ca74deac237a3" title="Value returned by a state-handler function when it handles the event.">Q_HANDLED()</a> and <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#a4b1bc93dc610e97650f324dc7901cd86" title="The macro returned from a non-hierarchical state-handler function when it ignores (does not handle) t...">Q_IGNORED()</a> have been added to return the status of event handled and event ignored, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all callback functions are now consistently called /c #XXX_onYYY():<ul>
<li>Q_assert_handler() is now <a class="el" href="qassert_8h.html#a4b763b7acf73342465ab91d5752f1b14">Q_onAssert()</a></li>
<li>QF_start() is now <a class="el" href="qf_8h.html#a189a6d2ece787717c81fbf51fd180732" title="Startup QF callback.">QF_onStartup()</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the new header file <a class="el" href="qevent_8h.html" title="QEvent class and basic macros used by all QP components.">qevent.h</a> has been broken off the <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html" title="Public QEP/C interface.">qep.h</a> header file. <a class="el" href="qevent_8h.html" title="QEvent class and basic macros used by all QP components.">qevent.h</a> contains the <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> class and other basic facilities used in the whole QP. This new file allows easier replacement of the entire QEP event processor with custom event processors, if you wish do so.</li>
<li>the macro QEP_SIGNAL_SIZE is renamed to <a class="el" href="qevent_8h.html#afdaa94c40e947b0340b4259eddce3561" title="The size (in bytes) of the signal of an event. Valid values: 1, 2, or 4; default 1.">Q_SIGNAL_SIZE</a>.</li>
<li>the data type QSTATE is now deprecated. Please use QState.</li>
<li>the "protected" in C don't no longer have the trailing underscore. For example, QHsm_ctor_() is replaced with <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#a8b773acc2e243ce416869ab83ee5679c" title="protected &quot;constructor&quot; of a HSM.

<li>the native QF event queues (both the active object event queues and the "raw" thread-safe queues) are slightly more efficient by counting down the head and tail pointers rather than up.

Version 3.4.01 (Product)</h2>
<p>Release date: Sep 25, 2007</p>
<p>This product release adds the backward-compatibility layer so that previous QP/C ports continue to work with the new version.</p>
<p>This product release also comes with the updated "QP Programmer's Manual", which now includes the QS target component and the QSpy host application.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_3_4_00"></a>
Version 3.4.00 (Beta)</h2>
<p>Release date: Sep 03, 2007</p>
<p>This release brings several changes with the overall goal of simplifying and improving consistency across the whole QP family of frameworks (QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano).</p>
<p>This release includes simplifying of the C naming conventions (see the updated Application Note <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_QL_Coding_Standard.pdf">"QL C/C++
Coding Standard"</a>). The double-underscore suffix for private data members of structures is no longer used. Single underscore is used still only for internal QP/C facilities that typically should not be used by the application programmer.</p>
<p>The main changes are made to the QEP component. The "static transition
optimization" has been removed altogether. This simplifies significantly the state machine structure (which now contains just the currently active state). Also, the efficiency is improved for processing the dynamic transitions and the stack usage is lower. This change brings the QEP/C implementation much closer to QEP-nano.</p>
<p>The other big change in this release is including the Quantum Spy (QS) component in the distribution. Previously, the QS component was available only under the commercial licensing. It is now open source, just as the rest of QP.</p>
<p>In, the QF/C component, the QTimerEvt_publishIn() and QTimeEvt_publishEvery() have been removed, because they introduced a coupling between time events and publish-subscribe. This is undesirable for projects that do not want to include the publish-subscribe facilty.</p>
<p>Finally, the revision history for individual QP/C components has been moved from the header files and is now consolidated in the header file doxygen/qpc_rev.h.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qpc_3_3_01"></a>
Version 3.3.01 (Product)</h2>
<p>Release date: Mar 17, 2007</p>
<p>The main change in this release is removing the 'const' declaration of two temporary variables inside <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#aa3aae49d6ee450d49a876b203db19105" title="Dispatches an event to a HSM.">QHsm_dispatch()</a> and QHsm_tran() functions. This was necessary to compile the code with the MPLAB C18 compiler for PIC18 devices.</p>
<p>Other minor changes include adding the 'U' suffix (unsigned) to several numerical literals to avoid MPLAB C18 compiler warnings.</p>
<p>The changes in release 3.3.01 have NO impact on the existing QP/C ports.</p>

Version 3.3.00 (Product)</h2>
<p>Release date: Jan 22, 2007</p>
<p>The main change in this release is removing #include &lt;stdint.h&gt; from the <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html" title="Public QEP/C interface.">qep.h</a> header file. This has been done becasue vast majority of embedded compilers for small MCUs actually do not provide the C-99 Standard header file &lt;stdint.h&gt;. Worse, compilers such as Freescale HC(S)08 C/C++ compiler will not include &lt;stdint.h&gt; unless it's in the compilers's include directory, even though the "stdint.h" file might be in the compiler include path.</p>
<p>Removing the "#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;" from <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html" title="Public QEP/C interface.">qep.h</a> header file allows more flexibility in the way the standard exact-width integer types are defined. For compilers that do not provide the &lt;stdint.h&gt; file, you provide the typedef's in the qpc_port.h file before including <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html" title="Public QEP/C interface.">qep.h</a>. For compilers that do provide the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header file, you simply include this file in the qpc_port.h header file before including <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html" title="Public QEP/C interface.">qep.h</a>.</p>
<p>The changes in release 3.3.00 have impact on all QP ports, because you need to modify the qpc_port.h file in all these ports.</p>
<p>The other significant change in this release is adding the macro <a class="el" href="qevent_8h.html#ac4b8d7dd267fd787a004ad9b58ec2283" title="Macro to specify compiler-specific directive for accessing a constant object in ROM.">Q_ROM_VAR</a> for all constant objects allocated in ROM. The <a class="el" href="qevent_8h.html#ac4b8d7dd267fd787a004ad9b58ec2283" title="Macro to specify compiler-specific directive for accessing a constant object in ROM.">Q_ROM_VAR</a> macro has been added for the compilers like Freescale HC(S)08, which require far pointers to access the objects in ROM. Please note that specifying the pointer size for accessing a ROM objects is syntactically different than specifying that the object is allocated in ROM (see macro <a class="el" href="qevent_8h.html#a4f4cc7253c4d809b326498b40efd66d3" title="Macro to specify compiler-specific directive for placing a constant object in ROM.">Q_ROM</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, in release 3.3.00 the build strategy for QP ports has been simplified as well. Instead of separate Makefile for every QP component, such as QEP, QF, QK, and QS, not the "ports" directory contains a batch file "make.bat" that builds all the libraries at once.</p>

Version 3.2.05 (Product)</h2>
<p>Release date: Dec 08, 2006</p>
<p>This QF release rolls back the changes made to the reference-counting policy. The reference count of a dynamic event is incremented when the event is posted, but is NOT decremented when the event is retreived from the queue. The reference count is decremented only later, in the garbage collector (<a class="el" href="qf_8h.html#a40fe2f66781a8ac8170f0b188b879783" title="Recycle a dynamic event.">QF_gc()</a>).</p>
<p>This release adds direct support for event deferral (the "Deferred Event" state pattern) through methods QActive_defer_() and QActive_recall_().</p>
<p>Also this release adapts the QS code to the specifics of the Keil C51 compiler for 8051/251. In particular, the C51 compiler treats the identifier "data" as an extended keyword. To make the QS code compile with C51, all "data" used as a formal function parameter have been renamed. Additionally, this release fixes a minor bug in the <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#acdb495c1e5524b5d95aaff82c47f6db5a203a2d90e5e52d5dc95de9fee1aeb53a">QS_FUN_DICTIONARY</a> macro.</p>

Version 3.2.04 (Beta)</h2>
<p>Release date: Dec 01, 2006</p>
<p>This QF release changes the internal policy of reference-counting for dynamic events. The reference count of a dynamic event is now incremented when the event is posted to a queue and decremented when the event is later retreived from the queue. This policy pertains to both active object queues and native QF thread-safe queues (<a class="el" href="struct_q_e_queue.html" title="Native QF Event Queue.">QEQueue</a>).</p>
<p>Previously, the reference count of a dynamic event was not decremented upon retreival of the event from the event queue, but rather in the garbage collector (<a class="el" href="qf_8h.html#a40fe2f66781a8ac8170f0b188b879783" title="Recycle a dynamic event.">QF_gc()</a>).</p>
<p>This QK release adds two new features in QK.</p>
<p>The first feature added is the extended context switch for CPUs with co-processors, such as the x87 FPU accompanying the x86 CPU. As a fully- preemptive kernel, QK needs to save and restore the context of the co- processor accrosss the asynchronous preemption. This QK release adds a generic mechanism for saving and restoring extened context in the extended scheduler (QK_scheduleExt_()), which is used only at the exit from the interrupts (asynchronous preemptions).</p>
<p>The second feature added is the Thread-Local Storage (TLS) for reentrant libraries, such as the NewLib. This feature allows assigning per-thread memory and providing a hook (callback) activated at every context switch.</p>

Version 3.2.03 (Product)</h2>
<p>Release date: Nov 15, 2006</p>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to adapt the code to the shortcomings of the gcc compiler for handling data in program ROM for Harvard architecture CPUs, such as the Atmel's AVR or the 8051. In such machines, the data space (RAM) and program space (ROM) are accessed with different instructions. The gcc compiler does not automatically synthesize the correct code for accessing data placed in the program ROM, even though __attribute__((__progmem__)) is used. The workaround for the gcc is to add special assembly instructions to transfer the data from the program space to the data space. This version of QP/C adds macros for each data element allocated to the program space (delcared with the Q_ROM attribute). Please note that commercial compilers, such as IAR, handle data allocated in the program space (ROM) correctly and do not need any workarounds.</p>
<p>This release also fixes a few minor inconsistencies in the code (see the list below):/</p>

 <br/>
 The modification changes the responsibilities of QF_onIdle(), which now MUST at least unlock interrupts. A failure to unlock interrupts in QF_onIdle() will leave the interrupts locked all the time and would prevent the application from running.<br/>
 <br/>
 Also, the signature of QF_onIdle() now depends on the interrupt locking policy. In case of the "save and restore interrupt status" policy, the QF_onIdle() callback takes the interrupt lock key as parameter (to be able to unlock the interrups correctly).</li>

(See <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_QP_C_PC-Lint.pdf">http://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_QP_C_PC-Lint.pdf</a>).</li>
<li>This release is compliant with the "Quantum Leaps Coding C/C++ Standard" (<a href="http://www.state-machine.com/resources/QL_coding_standard.pdf">http://www.state-machine.com/resources/QL_coding_standard.pdf</a>). Among others, all public names are prefixed by "Q_", or "QEP_" to minimize compile-time and link-time name conflicts. In addition, QEP/C uses the C99 standard include file &lt;stdint.h&gt; (C99 Standard, Section 7.18). Pre-standard compilers are still supported by placing &lt;stdint.h&gt; in the compiler's header file directory.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> structure has been redesigned to use memory more efficiently. <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> takes up only 2 bytes now.</li>
<li>The QHsm structure now derives from the <a class="el" href="struct_q_fsm.html" title="Finite State Machine.">QFsm</a> structure, which promotes better code re-use. In particular, macros Q_INIT() and <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#a8f06cd90ba5060780fc61a4810e3eb50" title="Designates a target for an initial or regular transition. Q_TRAN() can be used both in the FSMs and H...">Q_TRAN()</a> are now common for both traditional non-hierarchical FSMs and for HSMs.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="struct_q_fsm.html" title="Finite State Machine.">QFsm</a> class has been redesigned to allow using entry and exit actions. Now the <a class="el" href="struct_q_fsm.html" title="Finite State Machine.">QFsm</a> class strictly avoids recursion, just as QHsm does (MISRA rule 70).</li>
<li>The QPseudoState type has been eliminated and replaced by QState.</li>
<li>The central QHsm class in QEP has been completely redesigned. The basic transition algorithm is essentially the same as described in "PSiCC", however the implementation is very different. The redesign was necessary to comply with the MISRA rules and to eliminate Lint warnings.</li>
<li>The event processor is now strictly non-recursive (MISRA rule 70), that is, event handlers never call themselves, even indirectly. (Previous algorithm required one-level of indirect recursion.)</li>
<li>Dynamic state transition is now default. Static transition optimization is still supported, but considered optional for performance tuning.</li>
<li>The artificial limitation of initial transitions targeting only immediate substate of a composite state has been removed (see "PSiCC" Figure 5.4[a]). Initial transitions can now target any substate, arbitrarily nested within the composite state.</li>
<li>This distribution uses the legacy Borland Turbo C++ 1.01 as the default compiler. Port to DOS with Turbo C++ 1.01 is provided along with GNU-compatible makefiles for the QEP library and sample applications. This compiler is not C99-compliant and does not provide the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header file. However, the port of QEP includes a minimal &lt;stdint.h&gt;, which should be placed into the INCLUDE directory of the Borland Turbo C++ 1.01 installation.</li>
<li>This distribution contains three sample applications: A simple time bomb (QBomb) to demonstrate use of <a class="el" href="struct_q_fsm.html" title="Finite State Machine.">QFsm</a>, a calculator (QCalc), and an exhaustive test of the QHsm class (QHsmTst). All examples are implemented as text-only application compiled with Turbo C++ 1.01. The QHsmTst sample application supports interactive and batch mode for exhaustive testing of the event processor. The source code for QHsmTst demonstrates also how QEP/C application code can be MISRA-compliant.</li>
<li>This distribution contains make files for the Turbo C++ 1.01 make utility, as well as GNU-compatible Makefiles. </li>
